Optional features I attempted:
1.3 animations in welcome screen
1.5 advance to Main Menu short after all animations
2.5 setting icons for buttons, not sure if it is valid but I attempted
3.11 apps play sound when scanning and a different sound when revealing mine
3.12 apps vibrate differently for scanning and revealing
3.13 app displays total number of games played, but not specific for each configuration
5.4 allow user to reset the number of times played

I guess that's it! Thank you for your attention!
